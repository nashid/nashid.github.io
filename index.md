I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Software Engineering from University of British Columbia under the supervision of Dr. Ali Mesbah. 
I am fortunate to be part of the [SALT lab](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/amesbah/salt/).
My research is in software engineering, with emphasis on AI-driven software analysis, code repair, and software testing. 
My research aims to understand the role of context for code-related tasks with large language models.

My work has been recognized by the <strong>ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award at ASE 2025</strong>, reflecting the broader impact and rigor of my research contributions.

I aspire to work at the intersection of academia and industry to build novel solutions, tools, and techniques that directly benefit software practitioners. I believe the boundary between academic research and industrial practice in software engineering will continue to blur, and I want to play an active role in fostering this bidirectional flow of knowledge to ensure both scientific advancement and practical impact. I am also interested in how technology might shape the trajectory of our civilization and in advancing AI research that aligns with societal benefit.
