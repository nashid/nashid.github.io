I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Software Engineering from University of British Columbia under the supervision of Dr. Ali Mesbah. 
I am fortunate to be part of the [SALT lab](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/amesbah/salt/).
My research is in software engineering, with emphasis on AI-driven software analysis, code repair, and software testing. 
My research aims to understand the role of context for code-related tasks with large language models.

My work has been recognized by the ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award at ASE 2025, reflecting the broader impact and rigor of my research contributions. My research has received over 500 citations (h-index: 10), including CEDAR which has been cited more than 300 times and featured in [an article by IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/few-shot-prompting#1003835713) on few-shot prompting.

I aspire to work at the intersection of academia and industry to build novel solutions, tools, and techniques that directly benefit software practitioners. I believe the boundary between academic research and industrial practice in software engineering will continue to blur, and I want to play an active role in fostering this bidirectional flow of knowledge to ensure both scientific advancement and practical impact. I am also interested in how technology might shape the trajectory of our civilization and in advancing AI research that aligns with societal benefit.
