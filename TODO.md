# Website Improvements for Academic Job Hunting

This document tracks planned improvements to enhance the website for faculty job applications in software engineering.

## High Priority

- [ ] **Research Statement/Vision** - Add a dedicated section or expand research description with:
  - Clear research vision and future directions
  - What problems to solve in the next 5-10 years
  - How work fits into the broader SE landscape

- [ ] **Research Artifacts** - Add links to:
  - GitHub repositories for tools/frameworks
  - Datasets, benchmarks, or artifacts
  - Shows reproducibility and impact beyond papers

- [ ] **Talks/Presentations** - Add a section listing:
  - Conference presentations
  - Invited talks at other universities
  - Workshop presentations
  - Shows visibility and communication skills

## Medium Priority

- [ ] **Teaching Philosophy** - Expand the teaching page with:
  - Brief teaching statement or philosophy
  - More detail about TA responsibilities (e.g., "Led lab sections for 50+ students")
  - Any innovative teaching approaches or materials

- [ ] **Featured Projects** - Highlight 2-3 key research projects with:
  - Brief description
  - Impact/outcomes
  - Links to papers, code, demos

- [ ] **Contact Information** - Make it very prominent:
  - Email clearly visible on every page (header/footer?)
  - Links to Twitter/X, GitHub, Google Scholar
  - Currently might be buried in CV

## Lower Priority

- [ ] **Collaborators/Network** - Mention key collaborators or research group
- [ ] **Students Supervised** - Expand with thesis topics or outcomes
- [ ] **Grants/Funding** - If involved in any grant proposals
- [ ] **Diversity Statement** - Some positions require this (can be separate PDF)
- [ ] **Professional Photo** - Consider adding if comfortable
- [ ] **Research Highlights** - Add section on home page
- [ ] **Google Scholar Profile** - Link prominently
- [ ] **Citation Metrics** - Add h-index/citation count if strong

## Notes

**For research-focused (R1) positions:**
- Emphasize LLM + SE research vision more prominently
- Highlight citation counts and h-index if strong
- Show research program's trajectory

**For teaching-focused positions:**
- Expand teaching section significantly
- Add teaching evaluations/feedback if positive
- Consider a separate teaching portfolio link

**For all positions:**
- Small differentiators matter in competitive academic job market
- Each improvement incrementally strengthens the application package
