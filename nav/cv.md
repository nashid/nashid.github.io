I am a final-year PhD candidate at the University of British Columbia specializing in software engineering, program analysis, and large language models (LLMs). My research investigates how contextual and structural program information can be leveraged to advance LLM-based software engineering tasks and agentic AI systems that can plan, code, test, and deploy with minimal human intervention. This work has resulted in publications at premier venues including ICSE, ASE, and TOSEM.

In addition to my academic research, I gained experience in industry R&D at Walmart Labs, Kaspersky, and IBM, where I designed and deployed large-scale production systems in distributed computing, application performance management, and cybersecurity. 

Earlier in my career, I had the privilege of contributing to the first-ever development of the Voter ID and National ID system for Bangladesh, at a time when no such infrastructure existed in the country. Working in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Bangladesh Election Commission, I helped build a system of national importance that established the foundation for transparent electoral processes and has since served millions of citizens.

I aspire to work at the intersection of academia and industry to build novel solutions, tools, and techniques that directly benefit software practitioners. I believe the boundary between academic research and industrial practice in software engineering will continue to blur, and I want to play an active role in fostering this bidirectional flow of knowledge to ensure both scientific advancement and practical impact. I am interested in how technology might shape the trajectory of our civilization and in advancing AI research that aligns with societal benefit.
