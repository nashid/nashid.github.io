I am a final-year PhD candidate at the University of British Columbia specializing in software engineering, program analysis, and large language models (LLMs). My research focuses on incorporating contextual and structural information into LLM-based software engineering tasks, leading to publications at premier venues such as ICSE, ASE, and TOSEM. I have proposed novel techniques for test generation, automated program repair, and code completion, which significantly improve state-of-the-art baselines. 

In addition to my academic research, I gained experience in industry R\&D at Walmart Labs, Kaspersky, and IBM, where I designed and deployed large-scale production systems in distributed computing, application performance management, and cybersecurity. Earlier in my career, I contributed to the development of the Voter ID and National ID system for Bangladesh in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Bangladesh Election Commission, a project of national importance with lasting societal impact. 

I aspire to work at the intersection of academia and industry to build novel solutions, tools, and techniques that directly benefit software practitioners. I believe the boundary between academic research and industrial practice in software engineering will continue to blur, and I want to play an active role in fostering this bidirectional flow of knowledge to ensure both scientific advancement and practical impact.
